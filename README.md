# FIFA World Cup 2022 Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the data from the FIFA World Cup 2022. It involves data cleaning, Excel formula creation, importing data into Microsoft SQL Server, using SQL functions for analysis, importing queries into Power BI, creating a dashboard, and personal growth and reflection.

## Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values in the dataset by applying appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal.
- Removed duplicate or redundant data entries to ensure data integrity.
- Standardized data formats and corrected inconsistencies to maintain consistency and accuracy.

## Creating a Formula in Excel to Determine the Winner

- Implemented the IF function in Excel to compare scores and determine the winner for each match.
- Provided specific examples showcasing the formula's application and its effectiveness in identifying match outcomes.

## Fixing Data Type Issues and Adjusting Column Headings

- Identified and resolved data type mismatches, ensuring that dates, numeric values, and text were appropriately formatted.
- Employed the nested trim and substitute formula to replace spaces with underscores in column headings for better usability.

## Importing the Dataset into Microsoft SQL Server

- Imported the cleaned dataset into Microsoft SQL Server, leveraging appropriate tools and techniques.
- Documented any necessary configurations or steps required during the import process.

## Presenting Deliverables using SQL Functions

- Utilized a variety of SQL functions such as AVG, SUM, and COUNT to calculate and present the deliverables.
- Developed custom SQL queries to perform complex aggregations, filtering, and data manipulations.

## Importing Queries into Power BI

- Leveraged Power BI's DirectImport feature to import queries from SQL Server, enabling seamless integration.
- Renamed and organized imported tables to ensure clarity and ease of use in Power BI.

## Limiting the Number of Variables in Power BI

- Made the decision to focus on the top 10 countries to simplify the analysis and improve visual presentation.
- Utilized PowerQuery's source code to apply the "TOP 10" selection for each table, optimizing the visualization process.

## Creating a Dashboard and Finalizing the Project

- Made necessary adjustments and enhancements to visualizations to ensure a cohesive and informative dashboard.
- Completed the project by creating a comprehensive dashboard that showcased the deliverables and key insights.

## Personal Growth and Reflection

- Emphasized the challenges encountered during the project and the strategies employed to overcome them.
- Highlighted the lessons learned, growth in SQL proficiency, and enhanced analytical skills through the project.
- Expressed gratitude for the opportunity to learn and develop in areas such as SQL, Power BI, and data analysis.
